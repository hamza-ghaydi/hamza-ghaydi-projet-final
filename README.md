# EasyFolio
This is my final project for the Lionsgeek module, a simple one-page website. I built it using HTML to create the structure, Sass (which gets turned into CSS) for styling, and Bootstrap to make it look good. To use this project, you'll need to clone it from GitHub and then install Bootstrap using the command "npm i" in your terminal. This will download all the necessary files.
